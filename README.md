# Company-Profit-Prediction-Analysis-Program
The Company Profit Prediction Analysis program utilizes a linear regression model to forecast company profits from expenditures in R&D, administration, and marketing. It begins by importing a dataset containing financial data of 1000 companies, including categorical variables like states, which are preprocessed using encoding techniques. Visualizations such as heatmaps illustrate correlations among variables.

The program splits the dataset into training and test sets, trains a linear regression model to predict profits, and evaluates its performance using R-squared values for both training and test data. Users interact by inputting expenses, which are then used to estimate profits based on the model's coefficients and intercept.

Key functionalities include displaying regression coefficients and intercepts, constructing an equation to represent profit estimation, and providing detailed breakdowns of how individual expenditures contribute to overall profit margins. This tool supports decision-making in business strategy by quantifying the impact of different financial allocations on profitability.

Designed for analysts, business professionals, and researchers, this program facilitates understanding of predictive modeling in financial contexts, offering insights into optimizing resource allocation for maximizing company profits and sustainability.
